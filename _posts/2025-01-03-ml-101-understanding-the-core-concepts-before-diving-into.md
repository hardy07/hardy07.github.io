## ML - classic definitions

Machine learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data.

**General Definition:**

> "Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."  
> — Arthur Samuel, 1959

**Engineering-Oriented Definition:**

> "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."  
> — Tom Mitchell, 1997

## What ML is?

If i could summarize the whole of ML in one sentence it could be....

> "A collection of tools and techniques that transforms data into meaningful decisions by making classifications on whether someone will like this film or quantitative predictions like how tall someone is."

So when we use ML techniques to classify something we call it classification and when we make prediction on something we call it prediction.

When we talk about classification, we’re asking, “What category does this data belong to?” like for example Will this person like this movie? Is this email spam or not? It’s about putting things into distinct buckets.

While on the other hand, prediction is a bit more like forecasting the future. It's about taking some data and estimating something continuous. How much will this stock price rise next month? Predictions involve estimating values rather than sorting things into categories.

These two approaches—classification and prediction—are the foundation of most ML tasks.
